## create the following website and style it using CSS:
### requirements:
- Centre your whole page, using 50% as your width. (Hint: look at margin
types).
- Set your main picture (of the classroom) to span across the screen, and
make it align with the rest of your page.
- Make your unordered list have no bullets, be aligned in the middle, and
have a different font (of your choice). (Hint: look at list-style-type). Give
them no padding.
- Set the background colour of your navigation to “orangered”, and give it 3px
padding. (See additional reading ‘CSS notes for professionals’ Chapter 9:
Padding)
- When links on the page are hovered over, the text should change to white.
- All links should have no text-decoration and be black.
The Articles
- Each article should be floated left, have a width of 32.4%, height of auto and
a border which is dark grey and solid. (See additional reading ‘CSS notes for
professionals’ chapter 10 and 14)
- The articles should have an additional property of display:inline-block.
- The paragraphs in the articles should be justified and have a padding of 10
px. (Hint: look at html children).
- The pictures should take up the full width of the articles and have a height
of 200px. This will distort the images slightly, but don’t worry about this.
- When the pictures are hovered over, the opacity should be reduced to half.
(See additional reading ‘CSS notes for professionals’ Chapter 19: Opacity)
- The “more” buttons should look the same as the pics above (in terms of
colours). This is left to you to work out.
- These buttons should be floated right, given padding and a border, as well
as a margin of 3px.
- When these buttons are hovered over, the background colour should
change to black and the text to orangered.
The Footer
- The text should be centered.
